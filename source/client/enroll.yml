        For CA auto enrollment, an identity is not created beforehand.
        Instead one will be created during enrollment. The client will present a client certificate that is signed by a
        Certificate Authority that has been added and verified (See POST /cas and POST /cas/{id}/verify).

        During this process no CSRs are requires as the client should already be in possession of a valid certificate.

        Certificate Authority that has been added and verified (See POST /cas and POST /cas{id}/verify). The client

        CA auto enrollment except that is required the identity to be pre-created.

        As the client certificate has been pre-exchanged there is no CSR input to this enrollment method.

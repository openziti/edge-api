      description: |
        For CA auto enrollment, an identity is not created beforehand.
        Instead one will be created during enrollment. The client will present a client certificate that is signed by a
        Certificate Authority that has been added and verified (See POST /cas and POST /cas/{id}/verify).

        During this process no CSRs are requires as the client should already be in possession of a valid certificate.

        Enroll an identity via a one-time-token that also requires a pre-exchanged client certificate to match a
        Certificate Authority that has been added and verified (See POST /cas and POST /cas{id}/verify). The client
        must present a client certificate signed by CA associated with the enrollment. This enrollment is similar to
        CA auto enrollment except that is required the identity to be pre-created.

        As the client certificate has been pre-exchanged there is no CSR input to this enrollment method.

        Allows a router to extend its certificates' expiration date by
        using its current and valid client certificate to submit a CSR. This CSR may
        be passed in using a new private key, thus allowing private key rotation or swapping.

        After completion any new connections must be made with certificates returned from a 200 OK
        response. The previous client certificate is rendered invalid for use with the controller even if it
        has not expired.

        This request must be made using the existing, valid, client certificate.
